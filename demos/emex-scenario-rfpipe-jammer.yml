description: |
    Two rfpipe nodes with a jammer midway in between.

    The rfpipe nodes are configured with different, complementary
    tx and rx frequencies. The nodes send traffic to each other.

    Scenario events:

    T=0
    The jammer is off and the two nodes start traffic to each other.

    T=20
    The jammer jams rfpipe-001 from an overlapping band with a 75
    percent duty cycle pattern and half second period.

    T=40
    The jammer jams rfpipe-001 and rfpipe-002 from an overlapping band
    with a 75 percent duty cycle pattern and half second period.

    T=60
    The jammer jams rfpipe-002 from an overlapping band with a 75
    percent duty cycle pattern and half second period.

    T=80
    The jammer is turned off.

    T=100
    The traffic flows top.

    T=110
    The scenario ends.
