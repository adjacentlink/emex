    Four rfpipe nodes in a square with a sensor node at the center.
    
            1 --- 2

            |  s  |
            |     |
            4 --- 3
    
    node 1, 3 and 4 are configured with a directional antenna,
    "sector_60_by_30_3dB" and node 2 has an omni with 20dB gain,
    "omni_20.0".

    While the node locations determine propagation delays between
    nodes, the demo is configured with propagationmodel=precomputed,
    which means the pathloss between nodes is set by the intial_conditions
    and scenario "pathloss" statements explicitly set the channel
    loss between nodes. This contrasts to "freespace", the default
    progagation model where pathloss is deterimend by inter-node
    distance and the transmitter frequency. The pathloss is set to
    90dB along the sides of the square and 120dB along the diagonals.

    rfpipe-001 and rfpipe-003 are initially pointed towards
    rfpipe-002.  rfpipe-004 is pointed towards rfpipe-003, which will
    not receive it (since it is pointing north).

    T=20 set all nodes to transmit multicast to all other nodes times
         per second with randomized transmit times.

    T=40 start a unicast traffic flow from rfpipe-001 to rfpipe-002 and
         antenna pointing are changed so rfpipe-001 and rfpipe-003 are
         pointed towards rfpipe-004. rfpipe-004 is pointed diagonally
         across the square towards rfpipe-002.

    T=60 the pathloss between rfpipe-001 and rfpipe-004 is increased to
         200 to break the link.

    T=80 all nodes move one position clockwise. Antenna pointings are
         changed so that all nodes point at rfpipe-002.

    T=110 all flows are stopped

    T=120 end the scenario
